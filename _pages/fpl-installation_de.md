We provide a precompiled KNIME-PMM-Lab-FoodProcess-Lab bundle for Windows users. You can download the complete PMM-Lab package via the main download link of FoodProcess-Lab:

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/foodprocesslab/files/latest/download?source=typ_redirect" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133" src="https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Button_DownloadFPL_tah.png" alt="Button_DownloadFPL_tah" width="212" height="59" /></a>

After unzipping the downloaded file you will see a new folder called "knime_#.#.#". Inside is an executable file called "knime.exe" which starts KNIME with PMM-Lab and FoodProcess-Lab.

If you have any problem with FoodProcess-Lab please feel free to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/foodprocesslab/tickets/" target="_blank">write a ticket </a>on Sourceforge.
