Food may contain hazards (e. g. viruses or bacteria) which can be harmful for humans and lead to foodborne disease outbreaks. These outbreaks and their investigations are becoming increasingly complex due to changing patterns in the global food production and supply chain networks resulting in more and more complex delivery networks. FoodChain-Lab helps you to collect, handle and analyze the huge amounts of food delivery data needed in such an investigation.

Supply chain data can be imported to FoodChain-Lab via Excel templates as shown in the <a href="https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de/index.php/data-collection-in-foodchain-lab/">Data Collection Tutorial</a>. To get a first impression of what you can do with FoodChain-Lab please watch the video demonstration below or download our flyer.
