Map and Analyse Global Food and Feed Supply Chains

1. Abstract
In case of foodborne disease outbreaks, rapid identification of the causative food product is essential, since the medical and economic damages grow with the duration of the outbreak. Recent foodborne disease outbreaks in Europe illustrated that there is a need for a software system capable of supporting investigations on supply chains as well as exposure assessments in crisis situations. To address these needs and based on the experience from these real outbreaks FoodChain-Lab (FCL) has been developed (https://foodrisklabs.bfr.bund.de). It is additionally capable of comprehensive data integration and management assuring highest possible data quality and integrity at any point in time.
The research project aims to disseminate the software FoodChain-Lab in Europe, to support on outbreak investigations and to develop more features of the software, especially on the domain of risk assessment.

2. Why our initiative is of interest to you?
Do you face sometimes a huge and confusing amount of tracing data within an outbreak investigation? Is that a reason for you to decide not to trace back? Do you wonder whether visualisation and analysis of such data could be accomplished faster and easier?
<ul>
 	<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
 	<li>Unstructured data in tracing is difficult to handle and to understand â€“ FoodChain-Lab has well defined data structures and a guided data collection workflow. Additionally, the project offers to integrate individual data formats for MS.</li>
 	<li>The analysis and visualisation of a huge amount of data is a complicated task that is automatically done by FoodChain-Lab.</li>
 	<li>You will have the opportunity to co-determine the direction of the development of a tracing software used all over Europe and steer its focus</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
3. What can you expect from the project?
<ul>
 	<li>You can participate in workshops about the use of FoodChain-Lab and general tracing aspects. Additionally you can apply for special workshops for and in your country.</li>
 	<li>You will have the opportunity to be part of a network of tracing experts from the MS for experience exchange.</li>
 	<li>You will be able to discuss and integrate your needs and wishes into the tool together with subject related software developers.#</li>
 	<li>You can ask for technical support on data collection, handling, analysis and interpretation using FoodChain-Lab during outbreak investigations.</li>
</ul>
